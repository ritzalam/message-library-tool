===================

This tool is to be used while building HTML5 client for BBB
together with bigbluebutton-messages module


## Usage

coffee coffeeApp.coffee //to start the application

At localhost:4000
* Click on Add Event 
* select the kind of event from the dropdown
* click "Send"

//This is a simplified version under construction.
Later on I will rebuild the feature for viewing and 
editing the json message before sending it
Also the Meeting Info fields on top of the page will be
used for editing the messages
